<p>A mission to helped interested residents of the Spring Grove Apartments qualify for better paying jobs, opening new doors of opportunity for them, was set into motion over a year ago.</p>
 
<p>After consulting with Greenville country schools and other various organizations, the team of volunteer instructors from Taylors First Baptist Church led by Ed Birkenstock, and assisted by Ed Rambo and apartment coordinator Evelyn Turner decided WorkKeys would be the perfect fit.</p>



	<p>According to the non-profit testing company, ACT, WorkKeys, is a job skills assessment test designed to match prospective employees to jobs and careers, through three skills areas -- Applied Mathematics, Locating Information and Reading for Information. </p>
 
	<p>The state of South Carolina requires all eleventh graders take the three-part test and successful completion of WorkKeys may lead to earning the National Career Readiness Certificate. Based on their performance students may receive, bronze, Silver, gold or platinum certificates. </p>
 
	<p>Birkenstock said the test is more preferable to taking other standardized test.</p>
 
	<p>“We found out that WorkKeys is now an integral part of the employment process here in South Carolina, as many employers now require the WorkKeys certificate to be able to go through the hiring process,” said Birkenstock, an educator by trade. “Without WorkKeys in some cases you can’t even be interviewed.”</p>
 
	<p>The classes are held from 12:30 to 3 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the Spring Grove management office. Initially intended only for apartment residents, they are now open to anyone interested. </p>

	<p>On this day, Birkenstock and volunteers Martha Greggory and Keith Dammann assist Theresa Davis with mathematics word problems. The 50-year-old Davis who’s taken the test before said passing test would be an accomplishment.</p>
 
	<p>“It would be great for me to get done with this test and make my kids proud,” Davis said. “I appreciate the instructors. They are very patient and work with you to get you to your goal.”</p>
<p>Birkenstock said he’s is thankful for help from volunteers and other organizations like United Ministries who supplied computer training for the students. </p>
 
<p>“It’s hard to decipher what I want to do now because I’m not really used to that door being open,” said Tiffanie Rogers, who recently finished the program and is currently searching for work. Used to working in warehouses and kitchens, she is glad for new potential employment options. </p>
 
<p>Next to Rogers, Rambo, currently assisting her with resume recommendations understands the feeling all too well. It’s one reason he chose to work with the program.</p>
 
<p>“[WorkKeys] takes people from a minimum wage job to significantly better where there’s a big percentage difference in income in some cases,” Rambo said. “It puts you in a job where there’s a possibility of continued advancement.” </p>
